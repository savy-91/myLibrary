High priority
=============

* Forgot password (send mail)
* Filter by user or 'mine' or 'all'
* Switch isFavorite, notes, file to user_books: if I don't have the book and add any of these, the book is added automatically
* Upload cover on manual add
* Handle authors and categories in forms
* Direct download of files (if allowed)
* Add fetched on books so we can tell apart automatic from manual entries
* Deleting only deletes relationship between user and book, not the book itself, unless you're the only one having it
* Test deploy
