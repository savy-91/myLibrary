High priority
=============

* Forgot password (send mail)
* Filter by user or 'mine' or 'all'
* Switch notes to user_books
* Upload cover on manual add
* Handle authors and categories in forms
* Direct download of files (if allowed from user's path field)
* Use json-schema package to its full extent (UI kit)
* Test deploy

Low priority
==============

* Parametrize URL with filters + page
* Export list to PDF
* Improve UI of selects
* My account
* Update meta tags and titles of website in each main page
* Add isAdmin on users
* Only admins can edit unless it's a manual entry

Issues
===============

Adding a book to the user works twice (once for add, once for merge)
