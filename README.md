# myLibrary: A playground turned actually useful app

This project started out as a playground to improve my knowledge on some technologies. As it grew, I found out that keeping track of my eBook collection and wishlist is
something I actually needed, so I'm continuously updating things and adding new features as I see fit.

## What's next

This is by no means a finished app and there might be bugs and unpolished features here and there. Feel free to submit PRs if you'd like :-)

## Tech stack

* Node.js + Express
* Vue.js + Nuxt
* Knex
* Objection.js
* Ava E2E test suite
* Google Books API
* MySQL
* Backpack to watch and build the application, so you can use the latest ES6 features (module syntax, async/await, etc.)

## How to install

``` bash
# install dependencies
